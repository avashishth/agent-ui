 User: I am very disturbed after reading a news article about and incident and am really concerned about the women safety issues.

Culprits are also not afraid of getting caught or prosecuted. The conviction rate is really low which also takes away the fear of being caught. Above that the empathy in dealing with these incidents is missing from the law enforcement agencies. I feel these are major issues.\nAI: - Your thoughts on the current situation suggest that you are passionate about the topic. \n\n- What are the key areas where you believe the law enforcement should focus their efforts? \n\n- Has there been any progress in addressing this issue so far? \n\n- What are some concrete actions people can take to contribute to improve the safety of women?\n\n- Has there been any successful movement or initiative related to this issue that you are aware of?\n\n    User: Law enforcement should improve vigilance and use technology to enforce strict law enforcement against criminals. There should be higher and faster enforcement which puts the fear of law in criminals. Helplines or SOS channels should be well manned and equipped to respond to calls quickly. There are a lot of initiatives started but has a huge gap in implementation.\n    AI: \n    - That's an excellent point about the need for increased vigilance and law enforcement action.\n\n- What specific actions would you recommend to ensure effective implementation of these solutions?\n\n- How can technology be used to enhance law enforcement's effectiveness?"
